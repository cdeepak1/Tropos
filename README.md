# TROPOS Satellite and Campaign Data Analysis

This project supports the analysis of satellite and airborne campaign data related to atmospheric composition, with a focus on the HALO aircraft missions and Suomi NPP satellite observations. Key objectives include examining pollution transport, fire-related events, and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) characteristics over regions such as Southeast Asia and the Amazon.

The workflow involves:
- Accessing and organizing satellite data (Suomi NPP via IDL/XML workflows)
- Processing HALO mission datasets (e.g., EA, EM, AC, CA, CB)
- Classifying and analyzing fire-related Tâ€“re (temperature-relation) profiles using CCN data
- Creating averaged spatial profiles and zone-based visualizations
- Comparing aerosol and meteorological conditions across regions (e.g., Delhi, Manaus, Zeppelin observatory)

This work contributes to atmospheric research initiatives at TROPOS, aiding in the understanding of regional pollution patterns and aerosol-cloud interactions.
